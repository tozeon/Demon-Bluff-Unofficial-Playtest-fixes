# Demon Bluff - Unofficial Demo Fixes

## Description

This is an unofficial patch for the playtest of [Demon Bluff](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3522600/Demon_Bluff/), which provides some fixes while the game prepares for it's official release. The focus is on fixing issues related to modding and a few other bugs encountered during the playtest. I originally made this mod in combination with my other mod, Reveal Dilemma, but decided it might be better as a standalone mod.

This mod is ***mod agnostic***. It may or may not work with other mods depending on how they are implemented.

## Why?

Although the game is still a ***demo/playtest***, I wanted to make small improvements for my own mods. Since I thought others might want the fixes, I decided to make it a separate stand-alone mod. The goal is a compatibility-friendly patch but I can not guarantee if it works with mods others have made.

## Current Fixes

- Game not ending when health is low

## Planned Fixes

- (mod focused) Killing other characters will not force player to use their pick ability
